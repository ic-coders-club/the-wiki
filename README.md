========

This repository is used to host the Coder's Club [wiki](https://github.com/benkrikler/the-wiki/wiki) (for now at least).
We want everyone to contribute to this and add to the wiki anything they find useful.

### Snippets
This repository also contains a few small demonstration pieces of code.
They are there predominantly to help newcomers to a computing by example.

A snippet should be brief (<40 lines) and focussed, showing predominantly one command / function.
We should also try to avoid repeating code already available online.  
If there is such code, it is better to put a link to that code on the relevant links page than add it to the repository (so you won't find any Hello World's in here).
