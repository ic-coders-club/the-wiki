Doxygen demonstration
=====================
The contents of this directory is intended to:
* Demonstrate doxygen usage,
* Show the sort of html output you can produce with doxygen,
* Provide an example configuration file.

The config file contained in this project is a slightly edited version of the file produced by running:
```bash
doxygen -g doxyconfig
```
See the doxygen man page and the [wiki](https://github.com/ichep-coders-club/the-wiki/wiki) for more.
